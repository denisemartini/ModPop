## Making some tables and figures for Ch.3 - ModPop study

I need to "finish up" and basically refine some of the results into better figures and tables for my chapter, so that I know where I am standing with this chapter a bit better. I will mainly be using R for this, and the directory where all the data and final outputs for this is going to be is D:\PhD_data_to_transfer\ModPop\figures_and_tables, so the R files will be there as well. This is more a log to keep track of what I am doing outside of that.
